This project is essentially to create an SVM model that attempts to predict if someone had previously reported a heart attack based on their demographics and lifestyle choices.

##Disclaimer
If you are reading this, part of the poster may be missing as my model is taking close to an hour to run (which is not good). I am currently frantically trying to get it running so I can post updated graphs and observations based on said graphs. Or maybe I just forgot to get rid of this message after fixing things.
